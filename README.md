# Flatland-Translated

The Flatland-Translated project aims to create a modern-day American English translation of the second edition of Edwin A. Abbott's novella _Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions_, first published in 1884 and now in the public domain. Abbott wrote it in his native British English using the vernacular and vocabulary of his era, making it difficult for many of today's readers to understand.

The original source material is a markup (html) file along with eleven associated image (gif) files, which were retrieved from Professor Thomas F. Banchoff's website at http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/~banchoff/Flatland/ on 12/31/2020. It is these twelve files that make up the initial commit of the main branch.

Another transcript, as well as high-quality scanned images of an actual physical copy of the book, can be found on the Wikisource website at https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Flatland_(second_edition). It appears there are discrepancies with Banchoff's transcript that need to be corrected before translating can begin.

If you're interested in assisting with this project, please don't hesitate to do so. If you're a beginner looking to get some basic, hands-on experience with Git, GitHub, Markdown, HTML, CSS, and/or Sass, then this may be a good project for you to consider getting involved with.
